# daily-word-detectives
_The Daily Word Detectives_ is a not-so covert replica of the famous web-based game "Wordle". Wordle was originally developed by Josh Wardle and bought buy The New York Times as part of their efforts to reach 10 million subscribers by the year 2025.

Similarly, a daily word detective has 6 attempts to guess a mystery word, which changes every 24 hours. With each guess the player is able to find out more about the mystery word if they're smart about their guesses. For example, if the entered word has the same first letter as the mystery word, then the entered word's first letter is highlighted in green. If the letter is present in the mystery word, but in the wrong position, then it is highlighted in yellow.
